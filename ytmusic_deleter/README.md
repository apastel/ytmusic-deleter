### Usage
When you run `ytmusic-deleter` with no parameters, you will see see the usage information. There are several commands available.

`delete-uploads`:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delete all tracks that you have uploaded to your YT Music library.

>Use the `--add-to-library` or `-a` option to add each album or song to your library from YouTube Music's online catalog before deleting it from your uploads. If a match could not be found, the album or song will remain in your uploads.
When using the `-a` option, you can also enable fuzzy matching with `--fuzzy` or `-f`. This is a less strict matching algorithm that will find more matches,
but may find inaccurrate matches in its current experimental state. Use the `--score-cutoff` or `-s` option to raise or lower the default matching score cutoff of 90. A value closer to 100 will be more strict, and a value closer to 0 will be less strict.

`remove-library`:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove all tracks that you have added to your library from within YouTube Music.

`unlike-all`:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reset all Thumbs Up ratings back to neutral.

`delete-playlists`:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delete all manually created YT Music playlists.

`delete-all`:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combo command that will run `delete-uploads`, `remove-library`, `unlike-all`, and `delete-playlists`.
#### Non-deletion commands:
`sort-playlist`:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort a playlist alphabetically by artist and then by song title.

>Use the `--shuffle` or `-s` option to shuffle the playlist instead of sorting it.  
Use `--custom-sort` or `-c` to define custom sort parameters Available parameters are: `artist`, `album_title`, `track_title`, and `duration`. See below for examples.  
Use `--reverse` to reverse the sort order.

`remove-duplicates`:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove duplicate tracks from a particular playlist.

>Use the `--exact` or `-e` option to only remove exact duplicates. This will skip the portion
that checks for duplicates that are similar matches but not the same exact track.

`add-all-to-playlist`:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add all library songs or uploads to a particular playlist.
